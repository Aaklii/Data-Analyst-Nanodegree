# P6: Visualizing North-Korea's Missile Testing History
> This project is a data visualization in the form of a Tableau story which summarizes the history of missiles tested by North Korea based on 'The James Martin CNS: North Korea Missile Test Database.'

## About
This project is an explanatory data visualization from The CNS North Korea Missile Test Database. The visualization communicates the history of missile testing in the country highlighting information such as success rate, test-site shifts, missile types.

#### The activities implemented in this project are:
1. **Choose a Dataset:** [The CNS North Korea Missile Test Database]( http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/).

2. **Find a Data Story:** Explore the dataset and craft a story around it.

3. **Create the Visualization:** Create an interactive visualization using Tableau.

4. **Publish it Online & Get Feedback:** Take constructive criticism to improve on the idea being conveyed that the visualization is trying to convey.

5. **Update the Visualization & Publish.**

6. **Document Steps 1-5.**

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me with my first experience to create visualizations that can be understood by the masses. I developed the ability to critically assess the effectiveness of visualization by undergoing the iterative process of creating visualization using Tableau.
