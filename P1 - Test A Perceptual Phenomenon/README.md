# P1: Test A Perceptual Phenomenon
> In this project, Stroop Effect, a classic result of experimental psychology is verified using descriptive statistics and statistical testing.

## About
In this project, a well-known phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect is investigated.

#### The activities implemented in this project are:
1. Understand the steps of the experiment.

2. Create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task.

3. From the given data collected from others who have performed the test, compute some statistics describing the results.

4. Perform a statistical test (t-test) to test the hypothesis.

5. Interpret your results concerning the hypothesis.

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me learn to identify the components of an experiment, how to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample, how to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results.
